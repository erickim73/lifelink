            Keeping your data safe is a priority. Learn how your information is protected when using LifeLink products.

            How we protect your data
            By default, LifeLink doesn’t train our generative models on your conversations. 
            LifeLink doesn’t sell your data to third parties.
            LifeLink deletes your data promptly when requested, except for safety violations or conversations you’ve shared through feedback. 
            How we use your data
            LifeLink may use conversations flagged for safety violations to ensure safety of our systems for all users. 
            LifeLink may use your email for account verification, billing, and LifeLink-led communications and marketing (e.g., emails sharing new product offerings and features).
            LifeLink may conduct aggregated, anonymized analysis of data to understand how people use Claude. 
            LifeLink may offer additional features, which will enable us to collect and use more of your data. You’ll always be in control and can turn off these features in your account settings.
